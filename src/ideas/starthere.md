**Structuring Your Design System**

IDEA is based on the Atomic Design Methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages) popularized by <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/"  target="_blank">Brad Frost,</a> but with a developer centric approach to naming and structure of the system.

- Attributes (Tokens)
- Actions (Functions)
- Elements (Atoms)
- Components (Molecules)
- Patterns (Organisms)
- Screens (Templates)
- Apps / Prototypes (Pages)



> Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. 

**Get started**


- View and edit with live updates run `yarn content`

**Adding Modules**

- We use the `*.html` extensions for components allowing us to add HTML formatting via file association in IDE's support - `content/elements/sample.html.md` for an example.

**Component Example / Markdown Structure**
